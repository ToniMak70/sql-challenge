# Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Data Analysis
  query1 will list the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  query2 will list the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
  query3 will list the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  query4 will list the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  query5 will list first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
  query6 will list each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
  query7 will list each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department  name.
  query8 will list the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
